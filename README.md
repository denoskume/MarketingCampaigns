# Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Project Scope and Objectives

**Project Title**: Marketing Campaign Analysis

**Objective**: Analyze marketing campaign data to understand customer behavior, identify key performance indicators (KPIs), and provide actionable insights to improve future campaigns.

**Tasks**:
1. Data Collection and Storage
2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Development and Evaluation
6. Data Visualization and Reporting
7. Documentation and Collaboration

## Data Collection and Storage

### 1. Generate Synthetic Data
We'll generate synthetic data with at least 1000 rows. The data will include columns such as `CustomerID`, `Age`, `Income`, `Education`, `Marital_Status`, `Total_Spending`, and `Campaign_Acceptance`.

### 2. External Data Link
For external data, we will use publicly available datasets. Here's an example link to a marketing campaign dataset on Kaggle:

## Next Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Write a script to clean and preprocess the synthetic and external data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to understand the data and identify patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract and engineer features for model development.
4. **Model Development and Evaluation**: Develop and evaluate machine learning models.
5. **Data Visualization and Reporting**: Create visualizations and generate a final report.
6. **Documentation and Collaboration**: Document the project and collaborate with team members.
